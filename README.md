NeuralNetworkTool is an application allowing the user to create, visualise an artificial neural network(in a nutshell - ANN) using a graphical user interface. Moreover the tool owns a built-in functionality to run the whole process of machine learning including basic preprocessing, selecting types of the input data, creating a logical model(network) that is able to learn from the data.
