# NeuralNetworkTool 

## 1. Introduction
NeuralNetworkTool is an application allowing the user to create, visualise an artificial neural network(in a nutshell - ANN) using a graphical user interface. Moreover the tool owns a built-in functionality to run the whole process of machine learning including basic preprocessing, selecting types of the input data, creating a logical model(network) that is able to learn from the data.

##  2. Usage

When starting the application, an user encounters the following simple form.
<img src="./assets/gif/app-1.gif" alt="app-1 gif" align="center" />
<p align = "center"><b>Figure 1</b>. Project's name entry form submission</p>

 He is asked for entitling the project he is going to create in the near future. The title should match the following regular expression <i>`/^[a-zA-Z0-9].*$/`</i>
 
After submitting the project's name, we are moving the real part (the meat) of the application - ANN's creator. The user has an access to layers' editor, where we can create, delete and modify extisting (or not!) ann's parts. An exemplary usage is presented on the `Figure 2` and the `Figure 3`, there is an opportunity to parametrize the layers, the network, and learning process with the available tools.
